                    Man, what? (Haha)</br>
                    This shit funny</br>
                    I was like, "Oof this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy"</br>
                    She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)</br>
                    And nobody gets hurt (Nobody)</br>
                    Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)</br>
                    So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)</br>
                    Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past</br>
                    I'm a whole different person (A whole different person)</br>
                    It's a gift and a curse (A gift and a curse)</br>
                    But I cannot reverse it</br>
                    I can't reverse it</br>
                    It was a gift and a curse</br>
                    And now I'm drinking too much, so I'ma talk with a slur</br>
                    Last time I saw you it ended in a blur</br>
                    I woke up in a hearse</br>
                    She said, "You loved me first" (First)</br>
                    One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"</br>
                    So I put Gucci on the fur</br>
                    And I put my wrist on iceberg</br>
                    One thing my heart tells me is, "Flex on a hoe every time they're insecure"</br>
                    I guess you came through</br>
                    I'm running from you</br>
                    Was your love for real? (For real? For real?)</br>
                    Is your love really true?</br>
                    She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)</br>
                    And nobody gets hurt (Nobody)</br>
                    Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)</br>
                    So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)</br>

                    But I cannot reverse it</br>
                    You gave me the runaround</br>
                    I really hate the runaround</br>
                    You really got me paranoid</br>
                    I always keep a gun around</br>
                    You always give me butterflies</br>
                    When you come around</br>
                    When you come around</br>
                    When you come around</br>
                    You let me know love is not the answer</br>
                    Not the answer, not the answer</br>
                    I love to do drugs so mind my manners</br>
                    I get high when you don't decide to answer</br>
                    Phone home, I need to phone home</br>
                    I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home</br>
                    I don't wanna leave</br>
                    I just wanna be with you</br>
                    You, you, you</br>
                    She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)</br>
                    And nobody gets hurt (Nobody)</br>
